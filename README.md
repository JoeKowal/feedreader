# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and asked to write a complete test suite using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). Tests were written to insure that all feeds have a valid URL and name, all feeds are being loaded properly, and that new feeds are being displayed correctly. A test was also written to verify that a hidden slider menu is performing correctly.


## How to use the application test suite

You can use the test suite by cloning this repository, and opening the index.html file in a browser. 
You will see the feed titles in the top portion of the screen, and below that you will see the Jasmine test suite.
The green bar at the top of the test suite shows a summary - there are 7 tests written, and 0 have failures - this means that your code is performing correctly according to the tests provided.

Below the summary, you will see a detailed list of the tests, broken out by section -- "RSS Feeds", "The Menu", "Initial Entries", and "New Feed Selection". Each section has it's individual tests listed. You may run the tests individually by clicking on them.
